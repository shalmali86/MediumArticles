**Title:** AI Agent Architectures and Implementation: A Theoretical and Practical Exploration

**Introduction** Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents have revolutionised industries by automating tasks, improving efficiency, and enabling data-driven decision-making. AI agents play a critical role in modern technology, from virtual assistants to autonomous vehicles. In this article, we'll explore what AI agents are, their types, and how to implement them in real-world applications.

**What Are AI Agents?**
An AI agent is a system that perceives its environment, processes data and takes actions to achieve specific goals. AI agents can operate autonomously or semi-autonomously, learning from their interactions and adapting to new scenarios.

**Key Components of an AI Agent:**

1. **Perception:** Sensors or data inputs that allow the agent to understand its environment.
2. **Processing Unit:** Algorithms and models that analyze data and make decisions.
3. **Action Mechanism:** Actuators or software outputs that execute actions based on decisions.
4. **Learning Capability:** The ability to adapt and improve performance over time using techniques such as machine learning.

**Types of AI Agents**
AI agents can be classified into various categories based on their capabilities and scope of operations:

1. **Reactive Agents**

   - These agents respond to stimuli without memory or learning capabilities.
   - Example: A chess-playing program that evaluates the current board state and takes the best possible move using a minimax algorithm.

   ```python
   def minimax(board, depth, is_maximizing):
       scores = {'X': 1, 'O': -1, 'Tie': 0}
       result = check_winner(board)
       if result:
           return scores[result]

       if is_maximizing:
           best_score = -float('inf')
           for move in available_moves(board):
               board[move] = 'X'
               score = minimax(board, depth + 1, False)
               board[move] = ' '
               best_score = max(score, best_score)
           return best_score
       else:
           best_score = float('inf')
           for move in available_moves(board):
               board[move] = 'O'
               score = minimax(board, depth + 1, True)
               board[move] = ' '
               best_score = min(score, best_score)
           return best_score
   ```

2. **Deliberative (Goal-Based) Agents**

   - These agents plan actions based on goals and the current state of the environment.
   - Example: A GPS navigation system that calculates the shortest route using Dijkstra's algorithm.

   ```python
   import heapq

   def dijkstra(graph, start):
       queue = [(0, start)]
       distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
       distances[start] = 0

       while queue:
           current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)

           for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
               distance = current_distance + weight
               if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                   distances[neighbor] = distance
                   heapq.heappush(queue, (distance, neighbor))
       return distances
   ```

3. **Learning Agents**

   - They improve performance over time using techniques like reinforcement learning.
   - Example: Netflix's recommendation engine, which learns user preferences based on past interactions.

   ```python
   from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

   X = [[5, 3], [10, 15], [20, 30], [30, 45]]  # Viewing history
   y = ['Action', 'Romance', 'Thriller', 'Comedy']  # Movie genres

   model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=1)
   model.fit(X, y)
   print(model.predict([[12, 18]]))  # Predict genre based on user behavior
   ```

4. **Autonomous Agents**

   - These agents can operate independently in dynamic environments with minimal human intervention.
   - Example: A self-driving car that uses sensor fusion and deep learning to navigate roads safely.

   ```python
   import cv2
   from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

   model = load_model('self_driving_model.h5')
   frame = cv2.imread('road_image.jpg')
   prediction = model.predict(frame.reshape(1, 224, 224, 3))
   print("Steering command:", prediction)
   ```

5. **Multi-Agent Systems**

   - A collection of AI agents working together to achieve complex objectives.
   - Example: A team of warehouse robots that coordinate to optimize product picking and delivery.

   ```python
   from threading import Thread

   def robot_task(name, items):
       for item in items:
           print(f"{name} is picking {item}")

   robots = [Thread(target=robot_task, args=(f'Robot-{i}', ['Item A', 'Item B'])) for i in range(3)]
   for robot in robots:
       robot.start()
   for robot in robots:
       robot.join()
   ```

**Steps to Implement an AI Agent**
Building an AI agent involves several stages, from defining objectives to deploying a working solution. Below is a step-by-step guide to implementation:
